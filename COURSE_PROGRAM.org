** How to read the schema?
- *WHITE* -- introductory blocks covering prerequisites for the rest of the course;
- *GREEN* -- main flow of the course with simple introductory lectures on QC and QML;
- *YELLOW* -- facultative lectures that are highly recommended and which explain additional topics about QML and QC;
- *RED* -- advanced level lectures which deeply explain the math and the principles underlying QML.
